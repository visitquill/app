# VisitQuill

A focused brief for your next appointment. Visit preparation, made with FinchNode.

**Site:** https://visitquill.onrender.com/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/visitquill/app

## Production integration

The previous synthetic demo integration has been removed. This client requests real patient-authorized records using [FinchNode production](https://finchnode.com/openapi.yaml) through the [shared connection service](https://github.com/visitquill/finchapps-connect). It never calls the public demo API or falls back to fixture data.

Production activation is pending operator legal/privacy details and a server-side live key plus webhook signing secret. Until that is complete, connecting fails closed with an explicit setup message. Deployment of this code alone is not evidence of a completed real EHR connection.

## Use

Choose record categories, click **Connect my EHR**, and complete FinchNode Hosted Connect and your own provider sign-in. Consent identifies **FinchApps Personal Health Tools**, the shared application behind these ten sites. Return here to view the authorized record. Each visitor session is isolated to this site's origin and expires after 30 minutes; free service restarts can end it earlier. Reconnect if necessary.

Appointment brief. Source names, dates, units, missing categories and partial sync warnings come from the production response. No patient identity, provider, measurement or connection is invented. FHIR Trail shows FinchNode's normalized records derived from FHIR, not an untouched FHIR bundle. ConsentLoom displays actual consent metadata. SourceWeave lists only the sources returned with the authorized record.

End this session removes local access. Revoke sharing or request deletion through [FinchNode data controls](https://finchnode.com/me). Sharing consent is for the common application, so revocation can affect all ten tools. Exported or printed copies remain on the user's device.

## Local development

Node 22.13+:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

The build outputs `dist/`. This is a React/Vite static frontend with responsive layouts, keyboard controls, visible focus styles and reduced-motion support. Development runs do not bypass production origin restrictions. To exercise authentication locally, run the backend's injected mock tests; do not relax its production allowlist or embed keys in the client.

## Render

Create a free Static Site from this repository, build with `npm ci && npm run build`, and publish `dist`. The supplied `render.yaml` documents the service and security headers. Public-repository deployments require a manual deploy after pushing a commit. The separate Node connection service runs on Render's free plan and may sleep.

CSP `connect-src` must allow only `https://finchapps-connect.onrender.com`. Deploy the backend and configure its secret environment before enabling live connections. **Never add API keys to Vite variables, source, browser storage, logs, README examples or Git.** No frontend environment secret is required.

## Privacy and verification

Read [the data-handling notice](https://visitquill.onrender.com/privacy.html). No clinical record is saved in browser storage; visible data is held in memory, cleared on hiding the page, and periodically revalidated. No browser agent tools expose medical data. Unit tests validate production envelopes and preserve source values. Backend tests cover origin/session isolation, scope checks, invalid environments, expiration and signed revocation without using real medical data.

A real patient must perform their own EHR authentication and consent; these tests do not claim successful patient connectivity. Availability varies by healthcare organization.

## Domain candidate

`visitquill.com` was available on September 8, 2026; Porkbun displayed $11.08 for initial registration and renewal. No domain was purchased. Availability and price can change. Add it to Render and the backend's explicit origin allowlist before use.
